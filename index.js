A *DCO Remediation Commit* contains special text in the commit message that applies a missing Signed-off-by line in a subsequent commit.  The primary benefit of this method is that the project’s history does not change, and there is no risk of breaking someone else’s work.

These authors can unblock this PR by adding a new commit to this branch with the following text in their commit message:\n`

If the contents of this commit were contributed on behalf of a third party (generally, the author’s employer), an authorized individual may add a Third-Party DCO Remediation Commit.  This may be necessary if the original author is unavailable to add their own DCO Remediation Commit to this branch.

If you are about to add a Third-Party DCO Remediation Commit under DCO section (b) or (c), be sure you are authorized by your employer to take this action.  Generally speaking, maintainers and other project contributors cannot sign off on behalf of project contributors, unless there is some relationship which permits this action.  It is your responsibility to verify this.

This PR can be unblocked by an authorized third party adding one or more new commits to this branch with the following text in the commit message.  Replace YOUR_COMPANY with your company name, YOUR_NAME with the name of the authorized representative, and YOUR_EMAIL with the representative’s email address.

If you have a local git environment and meet the criteria below, one option is to rebase the branch and add your Signed-off-by lines in the new commits.  Please note that if others have already begun work based upon the commits in this branch, this solution will rewrite history and may cause serious issues for collaborators ([described in the git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) under "The Perils of Rebasing").

You should only do this if:

* You are the only author of the commits in this branch
* You are absolutely certain nobody else is doing any work based upon this branch
* There are no empty commits in the branch (for example, a DCO Remediation Commit which was added using \`--allow-empty\`)

To add your Signed-off-by line to every commit in this branch:

1. Ensure you have a local copy of your branch by [checking out the pull request locally via command line](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/checking-out-pull-requests-locally).
1. In your local branch, run: \`git rebase HEAD~${commitLength} --signoff\`
1. Force push your changes to overwrite the branch: \`git push --force-with-lease origin ${pr.head.ref}\`\n\n---\n\n`
